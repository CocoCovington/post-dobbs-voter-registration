Documents and data analysis in support of The Texas Tribune story, "Abortion rights supporters struggle to keep issue top of mind for Texas voters" https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/19/abortion-texas-voters/

This story tried to find out whether there was a meaningful uptick in new voter registrations in Texas, especially among female voters, after the fall of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. I used voter registration data from a paid subscription to data analytics firm L2, who got their data from the Texas Secretary of State's office. I used SQLite Studio to run multiple queries, including voter registration numbers month to month, betwen 2018 and 2022; registrations among women during those times; and registrations among different age groups during those times. Sample queries are in this google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffYSWpEoYNFiC2ioAQi0A58p6ct_yLnTf3vcxwn5l3c/edit?usp=sharing
